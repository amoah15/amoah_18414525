                <h2>WEB DESIGNER</h2>     
            <p>       
             Web designers plan, create and code web pages, using both technical and non-technical skills to produce websites that fit their customer's requirements.
             They are involved in the technical and graphical aspects of pages, producing not just the look of the website, but determining how it works as well. Web designers might also be responsible for the maintenance of an existing site.
              The term web developer is sometimes used interchangeably with web designer, but this is misguided. Web developing is a more specialist role, focusing on the back-end development of a website and will incorporate, among other things, the creation of highly complex search functions.
            The growth in touchscreen phones and tablet devices has dictated a new way of designing websites, with the web designer needing to ensure that web pages are responsive no matter what type of device is being used. Therefore the need to test websites at different stages of design, on a variety of devices, has become an important aspect of the job.

                            <h2>WEB DEVELOPER</h2>
                            <p>Web developers build and maintain websites and web applications. Although their work usually focuses solely on the underlying software and databases (known as the 'back end'), some web developers work on the interface and visual design (the 'front end'), while others combine both ('full-stack development').
                                    In an agency or as a freelancer, a web developer's job is to create products that meet clients' needs. The work can be particularly varied with many projects to work on simultaneously and lots of meetings with clients to discuss their requirements and update them on progress.
                                    In all cases a web developer's primary task is creating reliable and high performing applications and services, which can be accessed over the internet. Job titles vary according to the focus of the role.
